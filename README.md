# Business-Card-Extraction-using-Easy-OCR
Hi, friends here I showed how to extract the data from Business cards and created a web app to view the details of Business cards✌️.

To Extract details from Business card images I used EasyOCR in this project.

The Business card contains, 
        * Name   * Designation  * Contact Number *Email-id
        * Website link   and    * Company name

Here I used Python Regular Expression to find all the details of the Business cards.

Here I created an empty string and added all details found by regex. 

Then I created the MySQL database and created the table with the column name of what are all the details in the Business cards.

Then I created the web app using Streamlit code in vs-code to Visualize the extracted Business card Data.

Thank you friends  I believe you all are enjoy this code😊👍.
